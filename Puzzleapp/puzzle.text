### Project Overview:

**Objective:** Develop a web-based puzzle game that challenges users to solve a unique puzzle within a limited time frame. The game will incorporate a grid-based logic puzzle where users have to arrange elements according to specific rules to complete the challenge.

### Key Features:

1. **Dynamic Puzzle Generation:**
   - Implement an algorithm that generates puzzles dynamically, ensuring a unique challenge for users each time they play.
   - Puzzles could be based on popular logic puzzles like Sudoku, Nonograms, or a custom logic puzzle that requires arranging grid elements to satisfy certain conditions (e.g., no two same elements in a row or column).

2. **Timer and Difficulty Levels:**
   - Integrate a timer to challenge users to solve the puzzle within a set time frame, adding a sense of urgency and competitiveness.
   - Offer multiple difficulty levels that affect the size of the grid, the complexity of the rules, or the time allowed to solve the puzzle.

3. **User Interaction:**
   - Allow users to interact with the puzzle grid, placing and moving elements according to the rules.
   - Provide visual feedback for correct and incorrect placements (e.g., highlighting, error messages).

4. **Score Tracking and Leaderboards:**
   - Track users' completion times and display high scores on a leaderboard to encourage competition.
   - Optionally, implement user accounts or sessions to remember past scores and progress.

### Technical Requirements:

- **Frontend:**
  - Use React for building the user interface, enabling dynamic updates and interactive gameplay.
  - Ensure the game is responsive and accessible, providing a good user experience across different devices and screen sizes.

- **Backend:**
  - Use Node.js for backend development, primarily to handle puzzle generation logic, user sessions, and leaderboard scores.
  - Store game data, including high scores and user progress, in a database. MongoDB or PostgreSQL could be used depending on the data structure needs.

- **Logic and Algorithm Development:**
  - Design and implement algorithms for dynamic puzzle generation, ensuring variability and adjustable difficulty levels.
  - Develop the logic for evaluating user solutions, providing instant feedback on the correctness of their moves.

### Deliverables:

- Source code for both the frontend and backend, including detailed documentation on the architecture and algorithms used.
- A deployed version of the game for live testing, hosted on a cloud platform.
- Instructions for setting up and running the project locally, including any dependencies and environment setup steps.

### Evaluation Criteria:

- **Gameplay Innovation:** The puzzle should offer an engaging and unique challenge that differentiates it from existing puzzle games.
- **Technical Implementation:** The logic for puzzle generation and solution evaluation should be efficiently implemented, demonstrating good algorithm design.
- **Usability:** The game interface should be intuitive and user-friendly, with clear instructions and feedback for the player.
- **Performance:** The game should perform well under different loads, with fast response times for user actions and puzzle generation.
- **Scalability:** The project structure should support future enhancements, such as new puzzle types, without major overhauls.

This project offers a blend of frontend interactivity and backend logic, challenging your skills in algorithm design, user interface development, and application architecture.
